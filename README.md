### Goal
We aim at identifying RBPs through different analysis methods, using the results of a genome wide proteome screening. RNA is a multifunctional molecule that not only acts as a template for protein synthesis but also interacts with proteins to form ribonucleoproteincomplexes. These complexes play crucial regulatory roles in numerous vital cellular processes, and the dysregulation of these processes are linked to many diseases such as mulitple sclerosis or cancer. Consequently, studying RNA-protein complexes is vital for unraveling intricate intracellular molecular patterns. This caused the rise of several comprehensive studies, which aim at identifying and categorizing RBPs on a proteome-wide scale. Beyond identifying RBPs, we cross-referenced our results with the RBP2GO database (Caudron-Herger et al., 2020) and developed a linear regression model.

### Where does data come from 
maiwens investigation + link
The data for the protein amount per fraction was collected using mass spectrometry and stored in a .csv-file. From this dataset, we aim to confidently identify RBPs using bioinformatic methods in R.
